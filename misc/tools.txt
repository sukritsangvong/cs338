1) >>> ifconfig
Then look for inet under eth0. 
(Used this when doing CS System Admin job on campus)

2) >>> ping HOSTNAME
Replace HOSTNAME with a domain name like >>> ping google.com. The next line 
will show the ip of the HOSTNAME.

Replace IPADDRESS with an ip address like >>> whois 142.250.191.206. The output will
show information about the host of the ip (Google)

4) Use sftp. The commands are the following: 
(assume that there is a file /home/kali/Documents/test-file.txt and want to transfer to mantis)
On Kali:
>>> sftp sangvongp@mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu 
>>> # enter my password
>>> put /home/kali/Documents/test-file.txt

5) >>> lsof -i :80 # to get from port 80
if nothing is shown, it means that there is no process.

6) >>> netstat -ltnp 
The hostname(s) will be displayed on the last column (PID/Program name) and 
the port will be the last chunk of digits in Local Address. Can also use grep
if know the name of the host.
